I'm Matheus, a Computer Science student and iOS developer from Brazil. I've been working with app development for two years, having solid experience, going from app conception to App Store publication.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 📍 Campinas, São Paulo.
- 📱 Always thinking on ideias to solve problems with an app.
- 👾 Love video games and emojis.
